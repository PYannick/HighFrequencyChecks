    <h3><strong>Welcome to the help page for the Shiny application for the
        HighFrequencyChecks (HFC) R package</strong></h3>
    <p>When running the app, you will see the main following screen.</p>
    <p><img src="hlpPic/MainScreenBlank.png" alt="" style="width: 1400px; height: 869px;"></p>
    <p>This screen is separated in several parts (by steps you should deal with
      during the configuration of your HFC report).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Uploading the necessary files</strong></p>
    <p><img src="hlpPic/Step1Blank.png" alt="" style="width: 381px; height: 626px;"></p>
    <p>1. Import the XLSform containing the survey questionnaire (in a tab named
      'survey') and the questions choices (in a tab named 'choices'). It has to
      be in the <strong>.xlsx</strong> format.</p>
    <p>2. Import the dataset against which you would like to run the HFC. It has
      to be a dataset generated form the questionnaire imported previously. It
      has to be in the <strong>.csv</strong> format.</p>
    <p>3. Choose if when you exported the questionnaire from kobo you did it
      with the generation of the groupname (which should be the good behavior).</p>
    <p>4. Import the sample size information (meaning the number of survey you
      intend to perform per site, and the number of points you sampled). It has
      to be in the <strong>.csv</strong> format.</p>
    <p>5. Import the shapefile use for the Site boundaries (you will have to
      select all the files, meaning the <strong>.shp</strong>, <strong>.shx</strong>,
      <strong>.cpg</strong>, <strong>.dbf</strong>, <strong>.prj</strong>, <strong>.qpj</strong>,
      and so on).</p>
    <p>6. Import the shapefile use for the sampled points (you will have to
      select all the files, meaning the <strong>.shp</strong>, <strong>.shx</strong>,
      <strong>.cpg</strong>, <strong>.dbf</strong>, <strong>.prj</strong>, <strong>.qpj</strong>,
      and so on).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Defining the necessary variables to execute the HFC</strong></p>
    <p>When uploading the files, you will see the table being updated</p>
    <table style="width: 1195px; height: 744px;" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 630.33px;"><img src="hlpPic/Step2Blank.png" alt="" style="width: 633px; height: 731px;"></td>
          <td style="width: 265.33px;"><img src="hlpPic/arrow_outline_blue_right_T.png"
              alt="" style="width: 101px; height: 77px;"></td>
          <td style="width: 882.997px;"><img src="hlpPic/Step2NotBlank.png" alt=""
              style="width: 635px; height: 735px;"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>By clicking on the variable name, you will be able to define the
      remaining variables (conditionally the status allows it to be defined).</p>
    <p><img src="hlpPic/NotSet.png" alt="">This status inform you the variable
      is not yet defined and it cannot be defined at this moment (one or more
      necessary files has not been uploaded yet, or another necessary variable
      has to be defined before).</p>
    <p><img src="hlpPic/CanBeSet.png" alt="">This status inform you the variable
      is not yet defined but could be.</p>
    <p><img src="hlpPic/Set.png" alt="">This status inform you the variable has
      been defined.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Defining the action to be performed on the dataset when
        executing the HFC</strong></p>
    <p><strong><img src="hlpPic/Step3Blank.png" alt="" style="width: 370px; height: 322px;"><br>
      </strong></p>
    <p>In this box, you can defined if you want the survey being marked for
      deletion if a specific test find the survey has an issue. See the
      functions documentation for more (especially the functions starting with <em>is</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Summary of the functions which will be executed based on
        the configuration</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong><img src="hlpPic/Step4Blank.png" alt="" style="width: 374px; height: 471px;"><img
        src="hlpPic/arrow_outline_blue_right_T.png" alt="" style="width: 101px; height: 76px;"><img
        src="hlpPic/Step4NotBlank.png" alt="" style="width: 370px; height: 470px;"></p>
    <p>When you launch the app, the <em>step 4</em> is blank, but when you will
      start to configure the variables, you will see the list being filled based
      with the functions which will be executed when running the HFC report. The
      list is determined based on the variables you have defined in the <em>Step
        2</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Generating the .Rmd</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong><img src="hlpPic/Step5.png" alt="" style="width: 376px; height: 80px;"></p>
    <p>This last step, will create the RMarkdown file to be executed to generate
      the report.</p>
    <p>In the same time the configuration defined is saved in the XLSform (tab
      'HFC'), for you not having to redo the whole process if you would like to
      update it.</p>
